# When and How to Lift the Lockdown? Global COVID-19 Scenario Analysis and Policy Assessment using Compartmental Gaussian Processes (NeurIPS 2020)

Compartmental Gaussian Processes (CGP) is a machine learning tool developed to guide government decision-making around measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

In addition to accurately modeling COVID-19 mortality trends for countries under their current policy sets, CGP can adaptively tailor forecasts to show the potential impact of specific policy changes, such as reopening schools or workplaces, allowing international travel, or relaxing stay-at-home requirements.

Unlike other spread models, CGP is able to tackle “What if?” policy questions looking into the future and the past. For example, CGP can estimate what would have happened if Italy’s government had waited a week before imposing lockdown measures, or predict what would happen if India were to loosen all existing spread prevention policies.
