This repo contains a JAX based implementation of the Approximate Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL) algorithm. The code is ready to run on the control environments in the OpenAI Gym, with pre-run expert trajectories stored in the volume folder. 

Example usage:

```python
from models import avril
from utils  import load_data

# First setup the data, I have provided a helper function for dealing 
# with the OpenAI gym control environemnts

inputs,targets,a_dim,s_dim = load_data('CartPole-v1',num_trajs=15)

# However, AVRIL can handle any data appropriately formatted, that is inputs
# that are (state,next_state) pairs and targets that are (action, next_action)
# pairs:
# inputs = [num_pairs x 2 x state_dimension]
# targets = [num_pairs x 2 x 1]

# You can define the reward to be state-only or state-action depending on use

agent = avril(inputs,targets,s_dim,a_dim,state_only=True)

# Train for set number of iterations with desired batch-size

agent.train(iters=5000,batch_size=64)

# Now test by rolling out in the live Gym environment

agent.gym_test('CartPole-v1')

```

This can be run by cloning this repository, creating a new virtual environment and running:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt

python AVRIL/models.py

```
