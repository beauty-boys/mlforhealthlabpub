## Requirements
This implementation is based on Python 3.6 (requirements.txt is included). It requires the causal multi-task Gaussian process (CMGP) model in [1,[url](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/mlforhealthlabpub/tree/main/alg/causal_multitask_gaussian_processes_ite)]
 and the conformal prediction framework [2,[url](https://github.com/donlnz/nonconformist)].
The data generating function of the synthetic datasets (SYNTH_A and SYNTH_B) is implemented within this implementation.
The exogenous semi-synthetic datasets (i.e., the IHDP and CPP datasets introduced in [3] and [4], respectively) are required. 

## Usage
```
run_experiment.py --data DATA [--file_path FILE_PATH] [--max_depth MAX_DEPTH] [--min_size MIN_SIZE] [--miscoverage MISCOVERAGE] [--weight WEIGHT] [--gamma GAMMA]
```
Required argument:
*  --data: types of dataset {SYNTH_A, SYNTH_B, IHDP, CPP}

Optional arguments:
*  --file_path: file path of dataset (for IHDP and CPP datasets)
*  --max_depth: maximum depth of partition (-1 for no limits)
*  --min_size: minimum number of samples for each subgroup
*  --miscoverage: target miscoverage rate
*  --weight: weight parameter (lambda)
*  --gamma: regularization parameter (gamma)
                        
Example 
```train
python run_experiment.py --data SYNTH_B
```
                        
## Results
This implementation produces the results of R2P in Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper.
