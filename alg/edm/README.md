## Dependencies

The code was implemented in Python 3.6 and the following packages are needed for running it:

- gym==0.17.2

- numpy==1.18.2

- pandas==1.0.4

- tensorflow==1.15.0

- torch==1.6.0

- tqdm==4.32.1

- scipy==1.1.0

- scikit-learn==0.22.2

- stable-baselines==2.10.1



## Running and evaluating the model:

The environments used for experiments are from OpenAI gym [1]. Each environment is associated with a true reward 
function (unknown to the imitation algorithm). In each case, the “expert” demonstrator can be obtained by using a 
pre-trained and hyperparameter-optimized agent from the RL Baselines Zoo [2] in Stable OpenAI Baselines [3]. 

In this implementation we provide the demonstrations datasets for the CartPole-v1 in 'volume/CartPole-v1'. Note that the 
code in 'contrib/baselines_zoo' was taken from [2]. 
  
To train and evaluate EDM on CartPole-v1, run the following command with the chosen command line arguments. 

```bash
python testing/il.py
```
```
Options :
   --env                  # Environment name. 
   --num_trajectories	  # Number of expert trajectories used for training the imitation learning algorithm. 
   --trial                # Trial number.
```

Outputs:
   - Average reward for 10 repetitions of running EDM.  

#### Example usage

```
python testing/il.py  --env='CartPole-v1' --num_trajectories=10 --trial=0 
```
